## Dynamic Code Geneation

Never put off till run-time what you can do at compile-time.
~ D. Gries

I would go one step further and say: don't evaluate what you can compile. In languages like Lisp this is made a lot easier by its built in support for dynamic compilation. To get access to similar features in C, we will have to cast some pretty involved Unix spells.
